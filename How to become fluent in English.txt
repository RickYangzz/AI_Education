Is it possible to become fluent in English without living in an English-speaking country?
Below is my answer.

Several areas come to mind.
1. Design goals ability.
2. Manage time ability.
3. Search information ability.
4. Enough willpower.

Here are more specific details.
Your final goal is to become fluent in English. 
But before that, you need to build a frame through which you can grow effectively and efficiently.
The basis of this frame is your learning approaches and the materials you learned.
The hold of this frame is the time and energy you spend in English learning. If you are good at managing time, you can do better at this part.
The top of this frame is the goals you set in every stage or in different aspects.
Nobody can build a perfect frame at first, and we don't need to do things like that. 
The important thing is to continue building and correcting it in the whole learning process.

So, let's start.
The first thing you need to do is to figure out all of your problems in the target language.
Then, you should try to find the most appropriate way for each problem.
Finally, all you need to do is to keep this approach until success.

You may have such problems that I have written down below.
If you have other problems, the resolution is similar to others, use your time and energy to find the best way to solve them.
