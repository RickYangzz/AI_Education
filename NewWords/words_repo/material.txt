for those having difficulty cracking dynamic programming solutions i find it easiest to solve by first starting with a naive but working recursive implementation it essential to do so because dynamic programming is basically recursion with caching with this workflow deciphering dynamic programming problems becomes just a little more manageable for us normal people  thought process given two strings we tasked with finding the minimum number of transformations we need to make to arrive with equivalent strings from the get go there doesnt seem to be any way around trying all possibilities and in this possibilities refers to inserting deleting or replacing a character recursion is usually a good choice for trying all possilbilities  whenever we write recursive functions we need some way to terminate or else we end up overflowing the stack via infinite recursion with strings the natural state to keep track of is the index we need two indexes one for word1 and one for word2 now we just need to handle our base cases and recursive cases what happens when we done with either word? some thought will tell you that the minimum number of transformations is simply to insert the rest of the other word this is our base case what about when we not done with either string? we either match the currently indexed characters in both strings or mismatch in the first case we  incur any penalty and we can continue to compare the rest of the strings by recursing on the rest of both strings in the case of a mismatch we either insert delete or replace to recap  with a solution in hand we ecstatic and we go to submit our code all is well until we see the dreaded red text time limit exceeded what did we do wrong? let look at a simple example and for sake of brevity i annotate the mindistance function as  the tree of recursive calls 3 levels deep looks like the following i highlighted recursive calls with multiple invocations so now we see that we repeating work i not going to try and analyze the runtime of this solution but it exponential  the way we fix this is by caching we save intermediate computations in a dictionary and if we recur on the same subproblem instead of doing the same work again we return the saved value here is the memoized solution where we build from bigger subproblems to smaller subproblems top down  of course an interative implementation is usually better than its recursive counterpart because we  risk blowing up our stack in case the number of recursive calls is very deep we can also use a 2d array to do essentially the same thing as the dictionary of cached values when we do this we build up solutions from smaller subproblems to bigger subproblems bottom up in this case since we are no longer recurring in the traditional sense we initialize our 2d table with base constraints the first row and column of the table has known values since if one string is empty we simply add the length of the  empty string since that is the minimum number of edits necessary to arrive at equivalent strings for both the memoized and dynamic programming solutions the runtime is  and the space complexity is  where m and n are the lengths of word1 and word2 respectively   open sidebar  chatgpt   user good afternoon i like to learn a new word today can you give me some practice to help me learn it better? the new word is couple chatgpt
