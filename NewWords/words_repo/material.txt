for those having difficulty cracking dynamic programming solutions i find it easiest to solve by first starting with a naive but working recursive implementation it essential to do so because dynamic programming is basically recursion with caching with this workflow deciphering dynamic programming problems becomes just a little more manageable for us normal people  thought process given two strings we tasked with finding the minimum number of transformations we need to make to arrive with equivalent strings from the get go there doesnt seem to be any way around trying all possibilities and in this possibilities refers to inserting deleting or replacing a character recursion is usually a good choice for trying all possibilities  whenever we write recursive functions we need some way to terminate or else we end up overflowing the stack via infinite recursion with strings the natural state to keep track of is the index we need two indexes one for  and one for  now we just need to handle our base cases and recursive cases what happens when we done with either word? some thought will tell you that the minimum number of transformations is simply to insert the rest of the other word this is our base case what about when we not done with either string? we either match the currently indexed characters in both strings or mismatch in the first case we  incur any penalty and we can continue to compare the rest of the strings by recursing on the rest of both strings in the case of a mismatch we either insert delete or replace to recap  with a solution in hand we ecstatic and we go to submit our code all is well until we see the dreaded red text time limit exceeded what did we do wrong? let look at a simple example and for sake of brevity i annotate the mindistance function as  the tree of recursive calls 3 levels deep looks like the following i highlighted recursive calls with multiple invocations so now we see that we repeating work i not going to try and analyze the runtime of this solution but it exponential  the way we fix this is by caching we save intermediate computations in a dictionary and if we recur on the same subproblem instead of doing the same work again we return the saved value here is the memorized solution where we build from bigger subproblems to smaller subproblems top down  of course an iterative implementation is usually better than its recursive counterpart because we  risk blowing up our stack in case the number of recursive calls is very deep we can also use a 2d array to do essentially the same thing as the dictionary of cached values when we do this we build up solutions from smaller subproblems to bigger subproblems bottom up in this case since we are no longer recurring in the traditional sense we initialize our 2d table with base constraints the first row and column of the table has known values since if one string is empty we simply add the length of the  empty string since that is the minimum number of edits necessary to arrive at equivalent strings for both the memorized and dynamic programming solutions the runtime is  and the space complexity is  where m and n are the lengths of  and  respectively

Syllogisms are a type of logical reasoning often used in philosophical arguments. Logical reasoning involves abstract thinking: you approach a problem by organizing a series of steps (called premises) into a particular order

Syllogisms are the most common way of arranging premises into a good argument. A syllogism is a form of deductive argument where the conclusion follows from the truth of two (or more) premises. A deductive argument moves from the general to the specific and opposes inductive arguments that move from the specific to the general

All mammals are animals.
Camels are mammals.
Therefore, camels are animals.

As long as premise one and premise two are true, then the conclusion must also be true. If mammals are animals, and camels are mammals; there is no way camels aren’t animals!

Usually, syllogisms have three-parts   two premises and a conclusion   although “syllogism” is sometimes used to refer to any deductive argument.

The first premise is called the major premise the second premise is called the minor premise Universal syllogisms, like the one above, use all-encompassing words, such as , or only. Particular syllogisms, on the other hand, are only about some things

No humans are immortal.
Some organisms are immortal.
Therefore, some organisms aren’t humans.

However, we must remember that only when both premises are true can the argument be sound. A syllogism may state that all birds can fly, penguins are birds, and therefore, penguins can fly. Though the argument is logically valid, it includes a false premise (all birds can fly), making the argument unsound.

A syllogism is valid (or logical) when its conclusion follows from its premises. A syllogism is true when it makes accurate claims   that is, when the information it contains is consistent with the facts. To be sound, a syllogism must be both valid and true. However, a syllogism may be valid without being true or true without being valid.

ChatGPT can make mistakes. Consider checking important information.

First of all, a bit clarification about the problem. The problem statement can be rephrased as

Given two sequences S, T, how many unique ways in sequence S, to form a subsequence that is identical to the sequence T.

    The number is 3. And the formations as follows: 
                             
    "_" marks the removed character. 
As a typical way to implement a dynamic programming algorithm, we construct a matrix dp, where each cell dp[i][j] represents the number of solutions of aligning substring T[0..i] with S[0..j];

Rule 1). dp[0][j] = 1, since aligning T = "" with any substring of S would have only ONE solution which is to delete all characters in S.

Rule 2). when i > 0, dp[i][j] can be derived by two cases:

case 1). if T[i] != S[j], then the solution would be to ignore the character S[j] and align substring T[0..i] with S[0..(j-1)]. Therefore, dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1].

case 2). if T[i] == S[j], then first we could adopt the solution in case 1), but also we could match the characters T[i] and S[j] and align the rest of them (i.e. T[0..(i-1)] and S[0..(j-1)]. As a result, dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + d[i-1][j-1]

e.g. T = B, S = ABC

dp[1][2]=1: Align T'=B and S'=AB, only one solution, which is to remove character A in S'.

As one can observe from the algorithm, in the inner loop, we only refer to the values in the previous iteration, i.e. the values in the previous row of the dp matrix. Therefore, to optimize the algorithm, we could reduce the space by keeping only two arrays, instead of the entire matrix. The algorithm can be optimized as follows. The running time is then reduced from 448ms to 424 ms.

Given two strings s and t, return the number of distinct subsequences of s which equals t.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits on a 32-bit signed integer.


"The discovery of a significant treasure made the entire village excited.",
"She spent the entire day working on a significant project for school.",
"His significant contribution to the team's success was acknowledged by the entire group.",
"The scientist conducted experiments to find a significant breakthrough that could impact the entire field.",
"The entire class applauded her for the significant improvement in her grades, which was truly significant for her."

In the brute-force approach, we were not sure if an element should be included or not to form the longest increasing subsequence and thus we explored both options. The problem lies in knowing if an element must be included in the sequence formed till now. Let's instead try an approach where we include element whenever possible to maximize the length and if it's not possible, then create a new subsequence and include it.

Consider an example - [1,7,8,4,5,6,-1,9]:

Let's pick first element - 1 and form the subseqeunce sub1=[1].
7 is greater than previous element so extend the sequence by picking it.   sub1=[1,7].
Similarly, we pick 8 as well since it's greater than 7.   sub1=[1,7,8]
Now we cant extend it further. We can't simply discard previous sequence and start with 4 nor can we discard 7,8 and place 4 instead of them because we don't know if future increasing subsequence will be of more length or not. So we keep both previous subsequence as well as try picking 4 by forming a new subsequence. It's better to form new subsequence and place 4 after 1 to maximize new sequence length. So we have sub1=[1,7,8] and sub2=[1,4]
Can we add 5 in any of the sequence? Yes we can add it to sub2. If it wasn't possible we would have tried the same approach as in 4th step and created another subsequence list.   sub1=[1,7,8], sub2=[1,4,5]
Similarly, add 6 to only possible list - cur2.   sub1=[1,7,8], sub2=[1,4,5,6]
Now, -1 cant extend any of the existing subsequence. So we need to form another sequence. Notice we cant copy and use any elements from existing subsequences before -1 either, since -1 is lowest. sub1=[1,7,8], sub2=[1,4,5,6], sub3=[-1]
Now, 9 can be used to extend all of the list. At last, we get   sub1=[1,7,8,9], sub2=[1,4,5,6,9], sub3=[-1,9]
We finally pick the maximum length of all lists formed till now. This approach works and gets us the correct LIS but it seems like just another inefficient approach because it's costly to maintain multiple lists and search through all of them when including a new element or making a new list. Is there a way to speed up this process? Yes. We can just maintain a single list and mark multiple lists inside it. Again, an example will better explain this.

Consider the same example as above - [1,7,8,4,5,6,-1,9]:

Pick first element - 1 and form the subseqeunce sub=[1].

7 is greater than 1 so extend the existing subsequence by picking it.   sub=[1,7].

Similarly, we pick 8 as well since it's greater than 7.   sub=[1,7,8]

Now comes the main part. We can't extend any existing sequence with 4. So we need to create a new subsequence following 4th step previous approach but this time we will create it inside sub itself by replacing smallest element larger than 4 (Similar to 4th step above where we formed a new sequence after picking smaller elements than 4 from existing sequence).

    [1,    4,      8]
           ^sub2   ^sub1

This replacement technique works because replaced elements dont matter to us
We only used end elements of existing lists to check if they can be extended otherwise form newer lists
And since we have replaced a bigger element with smaller one it wont affect the 
step of creating new list after taking some part of existing list (see step 4 in above approach)
Now, we can't extend with 5 either. We follow the same approach as step 4.

    [1,    4,    5]
				 ^sub2
	
Think of it as extending sub2 in 5th step of above appraoch
Also, we can see sub2 replaced sub1 meaning any subsequence formed with sub2 always
has better chance of being LIS than sub1.
We get 6 now and we can extend the sub list by picking it.

    [1,    4,    5,    6]
				       ^sub2	
Cant extend with -1. So, Replace -

    [-1,    4,    5,   6]
	  ^sub3		       ^sub2	

We have again formed a new list internally by replacing smallest element larger than -1 from exisiting list
We get 9 which is greater than the end of our list and thus can be used to extend the list

    [-1,    4,    5,    6,    9]
	  ^sub3		              ^sub2	

Finally the length of our maintained list will denote the LIS length = `5`. Do note that it wont give the LIS itself but just correct length of it.
The optimization which improves this approach over DP is applying Binary search when we can't extend the sequence and need to replace some element from maintained list - sub. The list always remains sorted and thus binary search gives us the correct index of element in list which will be replaced by current element under iteration.

Basically, we will compare end element of sub with element under iteration cur. If cur is bigger than it, we just extend our list. Otherwise, we will simply apply binary search to find the smallest element >= cur and replace it. Understanding the explanation till now was the hard part...the approach is very easy to code🙂 .

I have used the input array itself as my maintained list. Use an auxillary array if you're restricted from modifying the input.
 
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLIS(vector<int>& A) {
        int len = 0;
        for(auto cur : A) 
            if(len == 0 || A[len-1] < cur) A[len++] = cur;             // extend
            else *lower_bound(begin(A), begin(A) + len, cur) = cur;    // replace
        return len;
    }
};
